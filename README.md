# KIM (KDE Image Menu) for Plasma 6

This is a community-maintained fork of the original KIM (KDE Image Manipulator) script, updated to ensure compatibility and optimal performance under **KDE Plasma 6**.

KIM is a powerful collection of scripts designed to enhance image management and manipulation directly within the KDE Plasma desktop environment. It provides quick access to everyday image operations through Konqueror/Dolphin service menus.
